# Data-Science-Project

I made a project in which I analyze the calories I consume over a range of time. In the analysis I use Pandas, Numpy and Scikit-learn. I programmed everything in Google Colab with Python language and I used Microsoft Excel to place all the data to be analyzed. The project was divided into four phases, one for business understanding, the second for data understanding, the third for data preparation and finally for data modeling.
